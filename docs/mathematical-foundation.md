# Mathematical Foundation

Robotics heavily relies on a robust mathematical foundation. To succeed in this course, familiarity with the following areas is recommended:

- **Trigonometry**: Fundamental for analyzing angles, rotations, and transformations in robotic systems.

- **Linear Algebra**: Essential for understanding robotic motion, kinematics, and system modeling.

- **Calculus**: Used extensively for analyzing dynamics, motion planning, and control.

- **Probability and Statistics**: Critical for interpreting sensor data, uncertainty modeling, and robotics perception.

This section provides brief overviews and key concepts from these mathematical fields to refresh your knowledge and support your learning experience.
