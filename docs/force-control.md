## Motivation

In motion control problems, the goal is to move the manipulator to the desired trajectory by following a specified trajectory. While the premise of motion control might be basic in nature, it is a fundamental part of any higher-level robot manipulation. On the other hand, force control becomes mandatory for a robot to successfully carry out its task when interacting with its environment. Force control becomes essential whenever a robot end-effector makes contact with surfaces or objects, ensuring that the contact force is maintained at a desired level rather than unconstrained (which could lead to excessive force or loss of contact)‚Äã. A force control strategy modifies the robot joint position/torque based on force/torque sensors for the wrist, joints, and hands of the robot.
That‚Äôs why In the recent decade, research with robot force control has been increasing with an increasing number of use cases in medical, occupational, construction, and many other industries. Typically, any task that involves robot interaction with an environment such as polishing, cutting, scraping, pick-and-place, welding, etc. can benefit from the use of different methods of force control strategies. Another field where force control has a major role to play, and potentially have a big impact is physical human robot interaction. This typically involves a robot working in synchronous to the human where the robot measures the motion or forces from human and correspondingly responds to complete a desired task.

### Conceptual exercise
*List some real-world tasks where pure motion control would fail and force control is required. Describe what would go wrong without force feedback.*
- Peg-in-hole assembly ‚Äì without force control, the peg might jam or break if misaligned; force control lets the robot feel contact and adjust insertion force to guide it in. 
- Surface polishing ‚Äì a position-only robot might either press too hard (damaging the surface/tool) or too lightly (ineffective polishing); force control maintains a consistent polishing pressure. 
- Human handshaking robot ‚Äì purely position-controlled handshake could crush the person‚Äôs hand or miss it entirely, whereas force control allows gentle, adaptive gripping. 

‚Üí force control prevents excessive force and adapts to uncertainties in contact

## Chapter 1 : Interaction control overview
While traditional motion control focuses on following a desired trajectory regardless of external contact, force control aims to regulate how much force is exchanged between the robot and its environment. This raises a fundamental question: how does the robot respond to forces during contact? There are two broad paradigms for addressing this:

* Passive interaction control: the trajectory of the end-effector is driven by the interaction forces due to the inherent nature or compliance of the robot (i.e., internally, such as joints, servo, joints, etc.). In passive control, the end-effector‚Äôs motion naturally deflects under force, as in soft robots ‚Äì but this lacks flexibility (every specific task might require a special end-effector to be designed and it can also have position and orientation deviations)‚Äã and high contact forces could occur because there is no force force measurement. 

    ![Illustrative Video](https://youtu.be/4fnPVRWWEU8)

* Active interaction control: uses sensors (e.g. force/torque sensors) and feedback controllers to measure interaction forces and adjust accordingly the robot‚Äôs commands in terms of trajectory or object manipulation.  Active control can react to forces in real-time, providing flexibility and accuracy at the cost of added complexity and speed limitations. To obtain a reasonable task execution speed and disturbance rejection capability, active interaction control has to be used in combination with some degree of passive compliance. Active interaction control can be further grouped into indirect (such as admittance and impedance control) and direct force control strategies (such as hybrid force/motion control).
    
    ![Illustrative video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nvlki1xo-c)	

**Mathematical level**
To understand how active force control works mathematically, consider a robot at quasi-static equilibrium (i.e., moving slowly or stationary). In this case, the joint torques $\tau$ are related to the end-effector contact force $F_{tip}$ through:

$$
\tau = g(\theta) + J^T(\theta) F_{tip}
$$

Here:

* $ g(\theta)$ is the vector of joint torques needed to counteract gravity at the configuration $\theta$.
* $ J(\theta) $ is the Jacobian matrix mapping velocities from joint space to end-effector space,
* $ F_{tip} $ is the force applied at the end-effector.

This relationship explains both passive and active interaction behavior. In passive interaction control, $F_{tip}$ is the result of an external force applied to the robot, and the robot deflects accordingly due to its mechanical compliance.


In active interaction control, the same equation becomes a tool: we specify the desired wrench $F_d$, and compute the torque that would generate it:

$$
\tau = \tilde{g}(\theta) + J^T(\theta) F_d
$$

 where $\tilde{g}(\theta)$ is a model of the gravitational torques.

 This is open-loop force control. It assumes the robot's model and the environment are accurate, but it cannot correct for external disturbances or modeling errors. To improve robustness, we add feedback using a PI control law around the force error:

$$
\tau = \tilde{g}(\theta) + J^T(\theta) \left( F_d + K_{fp}(F_d - F) + K_{fi} \int (F_d - F)\, dt \right)
$$

This feedback formulation enables the robot to track the desired contact force even as the environment changes.

* Active Interaction Control: This type of control involves actively applying forces/moments to manipulate the environment. This type of control may make use of sensors, feedback controls to generate forces/moments that is appropriate. It is commonly used in tasks that require precision control like assembly, manipulation and where the robot has to actively push, grasp or move objects in the environment.
* Passive Interaction Control: It involves designing the robot or its end-effector to be compliant to external forces. Instead of active force application, mechanical design or the compliance of the robot allows it to naturally respond to external forces. Compliant materials such as springs, soft materials can be used for such use. By passive absorption or by dampening external forces safe and adaptive interaction with the environment is enabled. This type of control is common where human robot interaction is involved and sometimes it is used in combination with active based control.

## Chapter 2: Indirect and Direct Force Control
Active interaction control strategies can be grouped into two categories: those performing indirect force control and those performing direct force control. The main difference is that indirect methods regulate interaction forces through motion behaviors ‚Äî without explicitly closing a force feedback loop ‚Äî whereas direct force control explicitly commands and tracks contact forces through sensor-based feedback.

### Chapter 2.1 : Indirect Force Control

Indirect force control strategies achieve force regulation by modulating the robot‚Äôs motion response rather than directly commanding forces. The robot behaves like a virtual mechanical system ‚Äî typically, a mass-spring-damper ‚Äî so that when it is pushed, it responds with a restoring force, just like a compliant structure would. This means we are not controlling the force directly, but we are controlling how the robot moves when it encounters a force, which in turn determines the contact force. This behavior is what enables impedance and admittance control.

Imagine pushing on the end-effector of a robot. With only knowledge of the robot‚Äôs own parameters ‚Äî not the properties of the environment, we can design a controller so that the robot pushes back as if you were pressing on a virtual spring-mass-damper system, not because it's tracking a specific force, but because its motion is governed by a virtual dynamic behavior that generates restoring forces naturally. Rather than commanding the end-effector to follow a rigid trajectory, we move the setpoints (or stiffness) of a virtual mechanical system, and let that system produce compliant contact behavior.

This approach has powerful advantages:
- It provides intuitive and robust interaction with unknown environments.
- It enables stable behavior, even in the presence of modeling errors.
- If both the robot and the environment behave like passive (dissipative) systems, the overall interaction remains stable.

Indirect forced control can be further classified as :
* **impedance control** if the robot responds by generating forces (i.e., through joint moment(s) and/or force(s))
* **admittance control** if the robot responds by imposing a deviation from desired trajectory as a result of interaction with the environment.

### Chapter 2.1.1 : Impedance control

The concept of mechanical impedance is central to this strategy. Impedance quantifies how a system resists motion when subjected to a force. In robotics, impedance control aims to replicate this behavior: we do not directly command the contact force, but rather define how the robot should respond when force is applied to it.
Mathematically, the impedance $Z$ relates the force $F$ to the velocity $v$ of a system $F = Z v$


Depending on the desired dynamic behavior, $Z$ may represent different physical relationships:
- Inertial response: $F = ma$
- Spring-like response (Hooke's law): $F = kx$
- Damping behavior: $F = -bv$

In practice, robots are modeled as combinations of these components. We want to control the robot so that it behaves as if it were a virtual mass-spring-damper system. That means when a force is applied to the end-effector, the robot responds with motion determined by its dynamically adjusted virtual inertia, damping and stiffness.

![fig3.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Force/impedance_2.png)(Fig 3.4 Mechanical system in contact with the environment)*Created by Rahul Narasimhan Raghuraman*


This desired behavior is formalized by the following second-order differential equation:
$$
m_d \ddot{x} + b_d \dot{x} + k_d(x - x_r) = f_e \tag{3.5}
$$

where:
* $x$ is the end-effector position, and $x_r$ is the reference trajectory,
* $m_d$, $b_d$, and $k_d$ are the desired virtual mass, damping, and stiffness,
* $f_e$ is the external force exerted by the environment.

This equation governs how the robot yields to or resists external forces. A high $k_d$ makes the robot stiffer, resisting deviations from $x_r$; a high $b_d$ suppresses oscillations; and a high $m_d$ adds inertia to sudden force changes. The system doesn‚Äôt track force ‚Äî the force arises naturally through this interaction law.

Hence, by controlling the impedance of the robot we can manipulate the behavior of the end-effector depending on the interaction with the environment. For example, we can set very low impedance (or high compliance) and make it act like a very loose spring or we can set the stiffness very high where the robot would only move to the desired position without much oscillation.

But how is this mechanical behavior actually implemented in a robot? More specifically, how do we compute the joint torques $\tau$ that produce a response matching this desired impedance?

The key idea is to design a control law that cancels the robot‚Äôs internal dynamics and replaces them with the behavior of a virtual mass-spring-damper system. This is typically done in task space using the following impedance-control algorithm:
$$
\tau = J^T(\theta) \left( \tilde{\Lambda}(\theta)\ddot{x} + \tilde{\eta}(\theta, \dot{x}) - (M\ddot{x} + B\dot{x} + Kx) \right) \tag{3.6}
$$

Here:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\tau$ is the commanded joint torque,
  \item $J(\theta)$ is the manipulator Jacobian,
  \item $\tilde{\Lambda}(\theta)\ddot{x} + \tilde{\eta}(\theta, \dot{x})$ represents a model-based estimate of the robot‚Äôs actual dynamics (inertia, Coriolis, and gravity effects),
  \item $M$, $B$, and $K$ are the virtual impedance parameters ‚Äî the desired inertia, damping, and stiffness,
  \item $(M\ddot{x} + B\dot{x} + Kx)$ defines the force that would arise if the robot behaved like the desired mechanical system.
\end{itemize}

![fig3.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Force/impedance_1.png)(Fig 3.3 Diagram to describe impedance control)

This controller ensures that the end-effector behaves as if it were part of a virtual mechanical environment. When contact occurs, the response will reflect the tuned virtual dynamics ‚Äî not necessarily the real robot‚Äôs native dynamics. For instance, you can make a light robot behave like a massive, heavily damped system, enhancing safety and predictability during contact.

This control strategy can be visualized as compensating for the robot's true dynamics while injecting the desired mechanical impedance behavior.

![Illustrative example 1](https://youtu.be/KJ8s1BUHoks)
![Illustrative example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS1gSRcJbJQ)

Through impedance control, it is possible to achieve a desired dynamic behaviour. A subset of this task is to achieve a static behaviour. The approach consists in assigning a desired position and orientation and a suitable static relationship between the deviation of the end-effector position and orientation from the desired motion and the force exerted on the environment.  This is done by acting on the elements of K (stiffness) ‚Üí **Stiffness control** 

Stiffness control allows to keep the interaction force and moment limited at the expense of the end-effector position and orientation error, with a proper choice of the stiffness matrix, without the need of a force/torque sensor. However, in the presence of disturbances (e.g., joint friction) which can be modeled as an equivalent end-effector wrench, the adoption of low values for the active stiffness may produce large deviations with respect to the desired end-effector position and orientation, also in the absence of interaction with the environment.

  <summary>Impedance in the Laplace Domain</summary>

    To better understand how impedance behaves at different frequencies, we can use the Laplace transform. Taking the Laplace transform of Equation (3.5), assuming zero initial conditions, we obtain:

    $$
    (m_d s^2 + b_d s + k_d)\left( X(s) - X_r(s) \right) = F_e(s)
    $$

    Solving for the transfer function between force and position deviation:

    $$
    Z(s) = \frac{F_e(s)}{X(s) - X_r(s)} = m_d s^2 + b_d s + k_d
    $$

    This expression tells us how the robot resists motion across different frequency bands:
    - At low frequency ($s \to 0$): $Z(s) \approx k_d$ ‚Üí stiffness dominates.
    - At medium frequencies: $Z(s) \approx b_d s$ ‚Üí damping dominates.
    - At high frequency ($s \to \infty$): $Z(s) \approx m_d s^2$ ‚Üí inertia dominates.

    Thus, impedance is not constant ‚Äî it changes with the rate of motion, which is why impedance control can stabilize interaction with a wide range of environments.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Practical considerations for implementation</summary>
    In an impedance-controlled robot, the goal is to simulate the behavior:

    $$
    M \ddot{x} + B \dot{x} + K x = f_{\text{ext}} \tag{3.6}
    $$
    where
    * $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the end-effector task-space position (e.g., in $\mathbb{R}^3$),
    * $f_{\text{ext}} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the external force (or wrench) applied to the robot,
    * $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the virtual mass matrix,
    * $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the virtual damping matrix,
    * $K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the virtual stiffness matrix.
    \end{itemize}

    This equation defines how the robot should react to external forces by mimicking virtual mass, damping, and stiffness in task space. The robot senses its own position $x(t)$, velocity $\dot{x}(t)$, and in some cases acceleration $\ddot{x}(t) $ in order to compute motion deviations and apply corresponding torques.

    In practice:
    * Acceleration $ \ddot{x}(t) $ is often noisy and hard to measure.
    * It is common to set $M = 0$, eliminating the mass term for robustness.
    * Most implementations use only encoders and velocity observers ‚Äî no force sensor is required.
    * Virtual stiffness $K$ and damping $B$ are chosen based on the task and stability.

    Too high a stiffness value $K$ can cause problems, especially in stiff environments or with low-resolution sensors:
    * Small encoder errors or time delays can result in large torque commands.
    * This can lead to instability or oscillations.
    * Using backdrivable or compliant actuators helps mitigate these issues.

    Thus, while the impedance model provides a clear physical target, the actual controller must be carefully tuned and simplified in order to perform robustly on real hardware.

### Chapter 2.1.2: Admittance control
It is conceptually the dual of impedance. In admittance control, the robot (or its controller) monitors the forces and adjusts the motion commands in response‚Äã. Instead of directly outputting a force for a given motion error, an admittance controller takes a measured force input and yields a position or velocity adjustment. Practically, the robot is typically position-controlled at its core, but an outer loop takes the force error and computes a small shift in the commanded position (or trajectory) to relieve or accommodate that force‚Äã. For instance, if a force of 10 N is pushing the robot off its path, an admittance controller might say ‚Äúyield by 1 mm‚Äù (depending on a compliance setting) ‚Äì effectively, the robot moves slightly until the force reduces. 
Admittance control often involves two loops: 
* an inner high-bandwidth control loop where the compliant velocity/position is controlled
* an outer force loop that modifies the target position based on force input.

For a similar example as described before (see Fig. 3.7) but with an additional reference trajectory to use and command the manipulator, xc.

Created by Rahul Narasimhan Raghuraman based on information from [4]

Based on this, the outer admittance filter is described by Equation (3.8) as ‚Äì

$$
    m_d(\ddot{x}_c - \ddot{x}_r) + b_d(\dot{x}_c - \dot{x}_r) + k_d(x_c - x_r) = f_e \tag{3.8}
$$
In many implementations, $\dot{x}_r$ and $\ddot{x}_r$ are zero, simplifying to:

$$
    m_d \ddot{x}_c + b_d \dot{x}_c + k_d(x_c - x_r) = f_e 
$$
This dynamic relationship defines how the commanded position $x_c$ is adjusted in response to the external force $f_e$.

The inner controller then drives the robot to track $x_c$ using a standard feedback law, for instance:
$$
    k_p(x_c - x) + k_v(\dot{x}_c - \dot{x}_r)
$$

Here, $k_p$ and $k_v$ are the gains of feedback.

![Illustrative example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRbAesam-EE)

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Admittance in the Laplace Domain</summary>
Just like impedance, admittance is often studied in the frequency domain. Starting from the equation:

$$
m_d \ddot{x}_c + b_d \dot{x}_c + k_d (x_c - x_r) = f_e
$$

we take the Laplace transform (assuming $x_r = 0$), which yields:

$$
(m_d s^2 + b_d s + k_d) X_c(s) = F_e(s)
$$

Solving for the transfer function gives the admittance:

$$
Y(s) = \frac{X_c(s)}{F_e(s)} = \frac{1}{m_d s^2 + b_d s + k_d}
$$

This is the inverse of the impedance $Z(s)$. The admittance $Y(s)$ tells us how much motion results from a given force input, and its behavior depends on frequency:

* At low frequency, $Y(s)$ is dominated by stiffness $k_d$,
* At medium frequency, by damping $b_d$,
* At high frequency, by inertia $m_d$.


Low admittance (i.e., small motion in response to force) tends to enhance stability; high admittance (fast motion) may lead to instability if not properly controlled.
</details>


Both impedance and admittance achieve force indirectly by shaping how the robot responds to contact. They can be used to make a robot compliant without sacrificing stability. However, they have different practical considerations: for example, admittance control assumes a very stiff inner position control (common in industrial arms) and adjusts commands externally, which works well when you can trust the position control to execute quickly‚Äã. Impedance control embeds compliance in the low-level control (joint torques), which can be more direct but may face stability issues if the environment is very stiff and the controller is also stiff‚Äã. In summary, indirect force control lets the robot simulate a mechanical behavior (softness or stiffness) to handle contact forces gracefully, rather than directly pushing or pulling with a specified force.

**Conceptual exercise**

*What is the difference between traditional position control with a PD controller and joint-stiffness control?*

The difference in the algebra is quite small. A PD control would typically have the form $$u=K_p(q_d-q) +
      K_d(\dot{q}_d - \dot{q}),$$
whereas stiffness control is $$u = -\tau_g(q)
      + K_p(q_d-q) + K_d(\dot{q}_d - \dot{q}).$$
In other words, stiffness control tries to cancel out the gravity and any other estimated terms, like friction, in the model. As written, this obviously requires an estimated model (which we have for iiwa, but don't believe we have for most arms with large gear-ratio transmissions) and torque control. But this small difference in the algebra can make a profound difference in practice. The controller is no longer depending on error to achieve the joint position in steady state. As such we can turn the gains way down, and in practice have a much more compliant response while still achieving good tracking when there are no external torques.

**Programming Exercise**

[2.1 Programming Exercise : Impedance controller](https://learningadaptivereactiverobotcontrol.github.io/book-website.io//documentation/L9-Impedance.html)

### Chapter 2.2: Direct Force Control

Direct force control uses explicit control based on the interaction with the environment and based on the interaction and contact force, the force at joint(s) of the robot can be controlled so as to complete the task.

Consider a 1-DOF, linear, position-controlled robot as in the figure below. One would like to control the contact force \( f \) between the robot end-effector and the wall so as to track a reference \( f_{ref} \), where \( f_{ref} \) is, for example, a constant positive value.
![direct_1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Force/direct_1.png)(Contact interaction between a one-dof robot and a wall.)

For that, one can use a Proportional-Derivative (PD) control law as below. Note that the command sent to the robot is \( x_{com} \), which is a desired position.
![direct_2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Force/direct_2.png)(Block diagram of a force controller to control the contact force between the robot end-effector and the environment. The Laplace variable s stands for differentiation with respect to time (d/dt).)


The Force/Torque (F/T) sensor measures the contact force between the end-effector and the wall. When there is no contact (first figure, top sketch), the contact force is zero, thus $f_{sensed} = 0$ yielding $f_{err} > 0.$

Assuming stationary initial conditions, one has next $x_{err} > 0,$ which implies that $x_{com} > x_{cur},$ which in turn makes the robot move to the right, towards the wall.

Upon contact between the robot end-effector and the wall (first figure, bottom sketch), the contact force sensed by the F/T sensor 
$ f_{sensed} $ becomes positive, but initially smaller than $f_{ref}$ ‚Äî assuming "soft" collision. Therefore, initially, one still has  $x_{com} > x_{cur} = x_{wall},$ meaning that the robot is commanded to penetrate the wall.

Finally, interactions between the PD controller and the stiffness of the end-effector, of the wall, and of the robot's internal position controller (characterized in part by its own PID gains), will eventually lead to a stationary state where $f_{err} = 0$ and $x_{com} > x_{wall}$ (so as to ensure a positive contact force).

But in general, the task complexity is much higher where we may have to provide a model to specify desired motion and contact force/moment corresponding to the constraints imparted by the environment on the robot. Typical strategy to work with such type of control system is hybrid force/motion control that generates motion in directions that are unconstrained and force/moment in task direction that are constrained


Pose estimation is the process of determining the position and orientation (pose) of a camera or object relative to a known reference frame, typically using 2D images and 3D world points. It plays a crucial role in robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision applications like object tracking, autonomous navigation, and grasping.

### Chapter 2.2.1: Hybrid Force/Mmotion Control
![Intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXu9C3joUSk)	

The aim of hybrid force/motion control is to split up simultaneous control of both end-effector motion and contact forces into two separate decoupled but coordinated subproblems

*(https://rocco.faculty.polimi.it/cir/Control%20of%20the%20interaction.pdf)(P 38)*

The idea is to decouple all 6 degrees of freedom of the task (3 translations and 3 rotations) into two orthogonal subspaces and apply either a motion based control or a force based control onto each of the axes. Unconstrained (free) axes are controlled in position while constrained axes are controlled by applying a constant force 

Consider the illustrative scenario (osrobotics.org) (Figure 3.10), where a robot end-effector slides on a table surface. Here, the vertical direction (Z-axis) demands force control to maintain consistent contact force, while the horizontal direction (X-axis) requires position control to follow a prescribed trajectory. Such scenarios frequently occur in grinding or polishing tasks.

**How to Choose the Constraints: Natural vs Artificial**
In hybrid force/motion control, one of the most important design decisions is how to split the task space into motion-controlled and force-controlled directions. This is not arbitrary ‚Äî it should be based on both the task requirements and the physical properties of the robot‚Äôs environment.
We make this decision by distinguishing between:
 * Natural constraints ‚Äî limitations imposed by the environment that restrict motion or wrench. These are not imposed by the robot, but arise from rigid contact (e.g. a table blocks downward motion, or a peg in a hole restricts lateral translation).

* Artificial constraints ‚Äî constraints imposed by the controller. These are where we actively control either position or force, depending on what the task requires.

In theory:
* Force control should be applied along directions that are naturally constrained (e.g. control the contact force along the surface normal).
* Motion control should be applied along directions that are unconstrained by the environment (e.g. free tangential movement).

A binary selection vector $s$ is often used to helps distinguish force-controlled and position-controlled axes. If $s_j = 1$, the controller prioritizes force control along the corresponding axis, enforcing a desired force $F_{d,j}$ while allowing position adjustment. Conversely, if $s_j = 0$, position control dominates, tracking the trajectory $x_{d,j}$ regardless of the force generated.The controller is then designed to enforce $$s_i(F_j - F_{d,j}) + (1 - s_i)(x_j - x_{d,j}) = 0$$.

This means: if $s_j = 1$ (force-controlled axis), track the desired force $F_{d,j}$ (let position adjust as needed), and if $s_j = 0$ (position-controlled axis), track the desired position $x_{d,j}$ (while allowing whatever force arises).

This structure allows the robot to behave appropriately in tasks with partial constraint ‚Äî controlling contact forces where needed, while allowing motion freedom in unconstrained directions.

Hybrid position/force control is based on a nominal model of the interaction. Inconsistency
may however occur in the measurements, due e.g. to:
1. friction at the contact (a force is detected in a nominally free direction)
2. compliance in the robot structure and/or at the contact (a displacement is detected in a
direction which is nominally constrained in motion)
3. uncertainty in the environment geometry at the contact
