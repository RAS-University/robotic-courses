# üõ†Ô∏è Do you have any trouble?

Don't worry, we're here to help! Below are solutions to some common issues you might encounter when using **Webots**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: `"python.exe" was not found.`

When running your controller, you might encounter the following error:

```bash
WARNING: "python.exe" was not found.
Webots requires Python version 3.9, 3.8, or 3.7 from python.org in your current PATH.
To fix the problem, you should:
1. Check the Python command set in the Webots preferences.
2. Check the COMMAND set in the [python] section of the runtime.ini file of your controller program, if any.
3. Fix your PATH environment variable to use the required Python 64-bit version (if available).
4. Install the required Python 64-bit version and ensure your PATH environment variable points to it.
```

‚úÖ Solution:
**Step 1: Check if Python is Installed**

Run the following command in your terminal to check the Python version:
```bash
python3 --version
```
or
```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not installed or if you need a specific supported version (3.7, 3.8, or 3.9), download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Step 2: Set Python Path in Webots Preferences

- Open Webots.
- Go to Tools ‚Üí Preferences.
- Under the General tab, locate the Python command field.
- Set this field to the correct Python path.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ '/assets/images/problem_solver/python.png' }}" width="500px" alt="python">


You can find your Python installation path using these commands:

**For Linux/macOS:**

To locate your Python executable, run:
```bash
which python3
```
or for a specific version:
```bash
which python3
```

Typical paths might be:

- `/usr/bin/python3`
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`

**For Windows:**
Use:
```bash
where python
```
This typically returns paths like:
- `C:\Python39\python.exe`

Ensure this path is correctly set in Webots Preferences.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: `"ikpy" module is not installed.`

When running your controller, you may encounter this error:

```bash
The "ikpy" Python module is not installed. To run this sample, please upgrade "pip" and install ikpy with this command: "pip install ikpy"
```
‚úÖ Solution:
Install the required module in the correct Python environment by executing these commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ikpy
```

> *Same procedure to do for any other libraries, modules that needs to be installed such as matplotlib, numpy,...*
