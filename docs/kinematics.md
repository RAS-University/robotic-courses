## Motivation

Cameras have become one of the most accessible and data-rich sensors for robots, offering a wealth of visual information compared to traditional positioning or distance sensors. Advances in hardware and algorithms, such as RGB-D cameras and visual-inertial fusion techniques, have significantly improved robot perception. In navigation, robots use vision to detect obstacles, estimate trajectories, and build 3D maps of their environment. For grasping, visual data helps identify objects, estimate their pose, and determine how to interact with them. The following sections will explore the geometric foundations of 3D vision and its applications in robotic grasping.
