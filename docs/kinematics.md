## 1. Prerequisites
To get the most out of this Kinematics module, it‚Äôs helpful to have:

1. **Basic Mathematics**  
   - Familiarity with **[trigonometry](mathematical-foundation)** (sine, cosine, angle addition formulas).  
   - Understanding of **[linear algebra](mathematical-foundation)** (vectors, matrices, basic matrix operations).  
   - Comfort with **[calculus](mathematical-foundation)** (especially differentiation), which is useful for topics like velocity kinematics and the Jacobian.

2. **Fundamental Physics or Mechanics**  
   - Basic concepts of **rigid-body motion** (translational and rotational movement).  
   - General understanding of **forces** and **torques** can be helpful, though kinematics itself does not address them directly.

While you don‚Äôt need to be an expert in any one of these areas, having a comfortable grasp of each will make your study of kinematics more productive and enjoyable.

## 2. General Motivation

![Delta Robot Pick and Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j5hPlHTZI8)
><sub>*Delta robot Pick and Place. YouTube video, 14 June 2021. Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j5hPlHTZI8*</sub>

Have you ever watched a precision robot‚Äîlike the Delta robot in the video‚Äîpick and place objects at incredible speed and accuracy? These agile machines seem are well known for their fluidity and precision. But behind the impressive motion lies a well-structured branch of mechanics called **kinematics**.

Kinematics, often referred to as the ‚Äú**geometry of movement**,‚Äù is the study of *how bodies move in space without considering the forces or torques causing the motion*. By focusing on the geometry and arrangement of joints, links, and end-effectors, kinematics allows us to:

- ***Predict and Control Robot Positions***: From assembly lines to surgical suites, robots must position their end-effectors at **exact points in space**. Kinematics equations provide the road map, telling us how each joint angle translates into a specific position and orientation.

- ***Design Efficient Mechanisms***: Whether it‚Äôs a Delta robot on a factory floor or a humanoid robot in a research lab, well-planned kinematic structures enable robots to work **faster**, with better range of motion and fewer mechanical constraints.

- ***Streamline Path Planning***: From pick-and-place tasks to drawing complex shapes, kinematics helps in **calculating paths**, ensuring the robot can move smoothly from one point to another without collisions or awkward joint motions.

In this chapter, you‚Äôll explore different ways of representing positions and orientations in 3D space, understand the kinematics behind common robotic joints, and learn a systematic way to map your robot‚Äôs geometry into the equations that bring the entire mechanism to life. By mastering kinematics, you‚Äôll have a strong foundation for making robots move **precisely** and **reliably**, unlocking a world of innovative possibilities.

### Chapter 0 : General Concepts
In this chapter we are first going to learn how to represent robots, what is a joint, degrees of freedom, etc. before diving into specific transformations (2D coordinate transformations, rotation matrices, homogeneous matrices) to clearly link theoretical concepts to mathematical formalisms.

#### **Serial vs. Parallel robots**
Among the various configurations in which mechanical components can be arranged, two key topologies are particularly significant in robotics:
- ***Serial Chains***: These consist of a series of rigid links connected sequentially by joints. Each link (except the first and last) is connected to exactly two other links. Serial chains are commonly seen in robotic arms.
- ***Fully Parallel Mechanisms***: These mechanisms have two primary components (often the base and the end-effector) connected by multiple independent chains. Each of these connecting chains itself typically forms a serial structure. An example is the Delta robot used in high-speed pick-and-place tasks.

For a visual comparison of these two robot types, watch the following short video:

#### **Drawing kinematic diagrams**
In robotics, accurately representing the structure of robots (left image) through **kinematic diagrams** (right image) is crucial. These diagrams help us clearly visualize joints, links, and their connections, facilitating easier calculation of mobility, degrees of freedom, and overall system analysis.

#### **Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**
<!-- - ***Degrees of Freedom (DOF)*** refer to the number of independent parameters required to completely specify the position and orientation of a robot or its parts in space. For instance, a rigid body in three-dimensional space has six degrees of freedom‚Äîthree translational (moving along the x, y, and z axes) and three rotational (rotating around these axes).

- ***Mobility*** typically refers to the number of controllable, active joints (motors) a robot possesses, directly determining its range of motion and the complexity of its achievable tasks.

To better understand these concepts, watch the following concise and clear explanation: -->
![Degrees of Freedom of a Rigid Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z29hYlagOYM&list=PLggLP4f-rq02vX0OQQ5vrCxbJrzamYDfx&index=4)
><sub>*Northwestern Robotics (2018) Modern Robotics, Chapter 2.1: Degrees of Freedom of a Rigid Body. YouTube video, 26 August 2017. Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z29hYlagOYM&list=PLggLP4f-rq02vX0OQQ5vrCxbJrzamYDfx&index=4*</sub>
>
><sub>*Lynch, K.M. and Park, F.C. (2017) Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.*</sub>

- ***Configuration of a robot*** is a representation of the positions of all the points of the robot.
- ***Configuration space (called C-space)*** is the space of all configurations
- ***Degrees of freedom*** is the dimension of the C-space, or the minimum number of real numbers you need to represent the configuration.

General rule which holds for any system, not just rigid bodies: 
$$
\boxed{ \text{DoF} = \sum_{}^{} \text{freedoms of } \textbf{points} - \text{number of independent constraints} }
$$

And since the robots are made of rigid bodies, 
$$
\boxed{ \text{DoF} = \sum_{}^{} \text{freedoms of } \textbf{bodies} - \text{number of independent constraints} }
$$

#### **Gr√ºbler‚Äôs formula and its application**
***Gr√ºbler‚Äôs formula*** is a powerful tool to quickly calculate the degrees of freedom of mechanisms, especially useful for complex robot configurations:
$$
\boxed{ \text{DoF} = m(N - 1 - J) + \sum_{i=1}^{J} \text{f}_i }
$$

Where:
- $m$ is the dimension of the space (e.g., $m = 3$ for planar mechanisms, $m = 6$ for spatial mechanisms).
- $N$ is the number of links (including the frame).
- $J$ is the number of joints.
- $f_i$ is the number of degrees of freedom permitted by joint $i$.


To clearly understand how this formula is applied, check out the following detailed explanation:

<!-- Now, try drawing the **kinematic representation structures** of the robots presented in **Exercises 2 and 3** from the set below.

  - $ k $ is the number of joints (connections)
  - $ \text{MO}_i $ is the mobility of each joint: -->

<!-- | Joint Type              | Mobility (MO) |

- $ \text{dof} = m(N - 1 - J) + \sum f_i = 6(11 - 1 - 15) + 39 = 9 $

This Delta robot as designed with the parallel bars and spherical joints has **6 supplementary mobilities**.
These mobilities concern **internal mobilities** not affecting the **pure translation of the mobile plate**. They are actually related to the **rotation of each bar around its principal axis**.

As you've seen, a **general motion in the plane** can be described by a combination of translations and rotations around the origin. A sequence of translations and rotations comes up against the fact that the translation is a vector addition while the rotation a matrix multiplication.

It would be very desirable to be able to integrate rotation and translation in a single operation in order to be able to link them together. The **homogeneous matrices** allow this integration of the translation into the transformation matrix. The price to pay is to increase the order of the matrix by one. Within the **rotation matrix \(R\)**, with **orientation \(Œ∏\)**, the **translation vector \(t\)** on x and y axis is added to the right and a line [0 0 1] at the bottom:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    R & \mathbf{t} \cr
    0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & t_x  \cr
    \sin \theta & \cos \theta  & t_y  \cr
    0           & 0            & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

<!-- This is **the homogeneous matrix** of transformation in a two‚Äêdimensional space (a plane), the third line has no spatial significance (no z axis for the moment !!). This matrix acts on a **homogeneous vector** in a two‚Äêdimensional space which consists of its two coordinates plus a "scale factor" equal to one:
$$
\mathbf{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x \cr
y \cr
1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$   

To find the familiar vectors, just delete the last element. Matrices and homogeneous vectors for three dimensions contain four elements. -->

In robotics, understanding how each joint movement translates into precise actions is essential. 

Watch the following video for an intuitive overview of **forward kinematics** before we delve into the mathematical details.

We'll start by exploring simple planar 2D robots, laying a clear foundation for mastering more complex robotic systems.

Now that we've seen how to compute forward kinematics using homogeneous transformations, let's explore **another insightful way** to approach planar rotations. Sometimes, it's more intuitive or practical to represent motion as rotation around an **arbitrary point \( p \)** rather than just around the origin.

A rotation around an arbitrary point \( p \) can be expressed through three intuitive steps:

1. **Translate** the point \( p \) to the origin.
2. **Rotate** around the origin by angle \(Œ∏\).
3. **Translate back** by moving the origin back to point \( p \).

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$
\begin{bmatrix}
    I & p \cr
    0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
    R & 0 \cr
    0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
    I & -p \cr
    0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    R & p - R \cdot p \cr
    0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$

This expression clearly shows that:

- **A rotation about any point \( p \)** is equivalent to **a rotation about the origin**, followed by a particular translation \( p - R p \).
- Conversely, **any combination of rotation and translation** in the plane can be represented as a pure rotation around a certain center \( p \).

Understanding this concept is powerful because it provides deeper insight into robot movements, especially when dealing with practical scenarios involving complex rotations or articulations around joints positioned away from the base.

Let's get familiriar with this type of method doing similar exercise:

### Chapter 4.5: Intro. to Quaternions

  <p style="font-size: small;">Quaternions Explained</p>
</div>

While Euler angles and rotation matrices are common ways to describe rotations in robotics, they have some limitations, notably the phenomenon known as **gimbal lock**: phenomenon that occurs when using Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) to represent orientations or rotations, typically in three-dimensional space. It happens when two of the rotation axes align, causing the loss of one degree of rotational freedom. In simpler terms, you become unable to rotate around one particular axis because two axes have essentially "collapsed" into one. Here is very nice [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8b2Jo7mno) explaining this phenomeon.

**Quaternions** are an elegant mathematical alternative for **representing 3D rotations**, avoiding issues like gimbal lock and allowing smooth rotational interpolations. They are widely used in robotics, computer graphics, and aerospace for their efficiency and accuracy in handling rotations.

For an intuitive, visual understanding of quaternions, it is recommended to watch the following engaging videos from the channel **[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)**:

As you have understood in these previous videos (if not we suggest you to re-watch from *17:25* on the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg)), **Quaternions** are a generalization of complex numbers containing:
- **a real scalar part** $ \lambda_0 $
- **three imaginary components** $ [\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3]^T$, which can be interpreted as a vector part $\underline{\lambda} $.

The **direction of the axis of rotation** $[x, y, z]^T$ is given by this vector $ \underline{\lambda} = [\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3]^T $.

The **angle of rotation** $\theta$ is introduced in the following way in the quaternion $ Q $:

$$
\lambda_0 = \cos(\theta / 2), \quad \underline{\lambda} = \sin(\theta / 2)[x, y, z]^T,\quad ||x,y,z||=1  
$$

The rotations are therefore represented by **unit quaternions**:

$$
\lambda_0^2 + \lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2 = 1 
$$

The quaternion multiplication rules are a generalization of the complex number multiplication rules:

$$
\boxed{ Q = [ \{\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3\} ] = [ \{\lambda_0, \underline{\lambda}\} ] = [ \lambda_0 + i \lambda_1 + j \lambda_2 + k \lambda_3 ] }
$$

with

$$
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 
$$
$$
ij = k,\quad ji = -k,\quad jk = i,\quad kj = -i,\quad ki = j,\quad ik = -j 
$$

Note the **multiplication is non-commutative**! (William Rowan Hamilton, Dublin, 1843)

These rules lead to a sequence of rotation M and L:
$$
Q_M Q_L = \begin{pmatrix} \mu_0 \\ \underline{\mu} \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} \lambda_0 \\ \underline{\lambda} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \mu_0\lambda_0 - \underline{\mu}^T\underline{\lambda} \\ \mu_0\underline{\lambda} + \lambda_0\underline{\mu} + \underline{\mu}\times\underline{\lambda} \end{pmatrix}
$$

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Useful formulas</summary>

The conversion from quaternion to direction cosines (rotation matrix) and vice versa is given by:

$$
R = \begin{pmatrix} 2(\lambda_0^2 + \lambda_1^2) - 1 & 2(\lambda_1\lambda_2 - \lambda_0\lambda_3) & 2(\lambda_1\lambda_3 + \lambda_0\lambda_2) \\ 2(\lambda_1\lambda_2 + \lambda_0\lambda_3) & 2(\lambda_0^2 + \lambda_2^2) - 1 & 2(\lambda_2\lambda_3 - \lambda_0\lambda_1) \\ 2(\lambda_1\lambda_3 - \lambda_0\lambda_2) & 2(\lambda_2\lambda_3 + \lambda_0\lambda_1) & 2(\lambda_0^2 + \lambda_3^2) - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} r_{11} & r_{21} & r_{31} \\ r_{12} & r_{22} & r_{23} \\ r_{13} & r_{23} & r_{33} \end{pmatrix}
$$

and the inverse transformation from the rotation matrix to quaternion is:

$
\lambda_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{r_{11}+r_{22}+r_{33}+1}
$

$
\underline{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \text{sgn}(r_{32}-r_{23})\sqrt{r_{11}-r_{22}-r_{33}+1} \\ \text{sgn}(r_{13}-r_{31})\sqrt{r_{22}-r_{11}-r_{33}+1} \\ \text{sgn}(r_{21}-r_{12})\sqrt{r_{33}-r_{22}-r_{11}+1} \end{pmatrix}

This new matrix will provide the relative distances $d_x$ and $d_y$ between the two end-effectors. When both $d_x$ and $d_y$ become zero, it indicates that the two robots are in collision.

### Chapter 6: Inverse Kinematics of Robots
<!-- 
Inversly as the forward kinematics, inverse kinematics (also called Indirect Geometric Model, IGM) allow us to find the values of the joint positions given the position and orientation of the end-effector relative to the base and the values of all the geometric link parameters. -->

Inverse Kinematics (IK), also known as the **Indirect Geometric Model (IGM)**, allows us to determine the required joint positions (angles and link lengths) based on the desired position and orientation of the robot's end-effector, given the geometric parameters of its links. This process is essentially the opposite of forward kinematics.

**What exactly is Inverse Kinematics, and how can we use it to move a robot from point A to point B?**  
IK is one of the most intriguing and broadly used concepts in robotics. Simply put, inverse kinematics involves calculating the robot‚Äôs joint parameters (such as angles and link lengths) to position its end-effector precisely at a specified location and orientation.

If you have a solid understanding of forward kinematics, inverse kinematics becomes straightforward and intuitive.

Watch the following video for a clear introduction to inverse kinematics:

> In this video, you will explore another example of inverse kinematics using a planar robot. Interestingly, this robot features both revolute and prismatic joints, making its parameters a combination of joint angles and link lengths. This type of robot is specifically known as an **'RRP' robot**.

### Chapter 8: Robot Singularities & how to find them

Singularities occur when a robot configuration causes it to lose the ability to move or become blocked in certain directions. Understanding and identifying these singularities is essential to safe and efficient robot operation.

For *serial manipulators*, the singular positions result from the **loss of degrees of freedom** while in a *parallel manipulator*, they result of the **gain of one or more degrees of freedom**. Most of the time, passing through a singularity causes **over constraint**, to then inducing the loss of control of one or more degrees of freedom. Which means, not controllable, which is not good.

### Types of Kinematic Chains and Mechanisms



#### Tree Structure  
A structure similar to a serial chain but can branch out. Each link can have multiple ‚Äúchild‚Äù links, forming a tree. A serial chain is a special case of a tree with no branching.

---

### Common Joint Types

- **Revolute (R)** ‚Äî Rotational motion around a fixed axis (e.g., a hinge).  
- **Prismatic (P)** ‚Äî Translational motion along a single axis (sliding joint).  
- **Helical (H)** ‚Äî Combined rotation and translation along the same axis (like a screw).  
- **Cylindrical (C)** ‚Äî A combination of one rotational DoF and one prismatic DoF about/along the same axis.  
- **Planar** ‚Äî Allows motion in a plane, typically two translational DoF and one rotational DoF.  

---

### Homogeneous Transformations

#### Rotation/Translation Representation  

A **homogeneous transformation** matrix represents both rotation and translation in a $4\times4$ matrix form. For example, a rotation about the $z$-axis by an angle $ \Theta $ is given by:  

$$
\text{Rot}(z, \theta) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 & 0 \\
    \sin \theta & \cos \theta  & 0 & 0 \\
    0           & 0            & 1 & 0 \\
    0           & 0            & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$  

Homogeneous transformations are fundamental in describing the position and orientation of each link and the end-effector in robotics.

---

### Constraints in Robotic Mechanisms

#### Holonomic Constraints  
Constraints that can be written purely in terms of **position variables** (joint angles, link displacements). For instance, most standard joints (revolute, prismatic, etc.) impose constraints that do not require velocities or accelerations in the equations. The number of constraint equations is $6 - n$, where $ n $ is the DoF of the joint.

#### Nonholonomic Constraints  
Constraints that **cannot** be expressed solely in terms of the position variables. They involve **time derivatives** of those variables and cannot be integrated to yield a relationship only between the joint coordinates.  
- *Example:* The rolling constraints of wheeled mobile robots (no slipping/skidding).

---

<h2 id="forward-and-inverse-kinematics"> Forward and Inverse Kinematics:

#### Direct (Forward) Geometric Model (DGM)  
Also called **forward kinematics**, it provides the **position and orientation** of the robot‚Äôs end-effector as a function of the robot‚Äôs joint variables $ \Theta $. Formally:

$$
\mathbf{T}_{\text{end-effector}} = f(\Theta)
$$

where $ \Theta $ can include both rotational and prismatic joint variables.

- **Serial Robots**  
  For serial robots, the DGM generally has **a single unique solution** for a given set of joint variables (i.e., one specific end-effector pose).

- **Parallel Robots**  
  For parallel robots, the DGM can have **multiple solutions** (often called ‚Äúcontortions‚Äù) for a given set of joint variables.

#### Inverse Geometric Model (IGM)  
Also called **inverse kinematics**, it is the inverse problem: given a desired position and orientation of the end-effector, find the **joint variables** that achieve it. Formally:

$$
\Theta = f^{-1}(\mathbf{T}_{\text{desired}})
$$

This can have multiple solutions (or no solutions) depending on the robot‚Äôs geometry.

- **Serial Robots**  
  The IGM for serial robots may have **several solutions** or sometimes no solution at all, depending on the desired pose.

- **Parallel Robots**  
  The IGM for parallel robots typically has **a single unique solution**, in contrast to serial mechanisms.

#### Jacobian  
The **Jacobian matrix** describes how a small change in the joint variables translates to a change in the end-effector‚Äôs **velocity** (or differential displacement). It is crucial for understanding robot motion, detecting singularities, and implementing control algorithms.

---

### Additional Useful Terms 

- **Workspace** ‚Äî The set of all points (and orientations) that the end-effector can reach. It can be subdivided into the **reachable workspace** (positions the end-effector can physically attain) and the **dexterous workspace** (positions the end-effector can reach with all orientations).
- **Singularity** ‚Äî A configuration where the robot loses certain motion capabilities (the Jacobian becomes rank-deficient). In these positions, small changes in joint angles can result in large or unpredictable changes in the end-effector pose‚Äîor no movement in certain directions at all.

---

## Useful Formulas for Robotic Kinematics

### Grubler‚Äôs Formula (General Form in 3D)

Also known as Kutzbach criterion, it gives the mobility $ MO $ of a mechanism with $ n $ rigid bodies connected by $ k $ joints:

$$
MO = 6 \times (n - k) + \sum_{i=1}^{k} (\text{MO}_i),
$$

where $\text{MO}_i$ is the contribution to mobility from the $ i $-th joint (often the joint‚Äôs DoF).

> **Note:** Variations of this formula exist depending on whether you consider closed chains, higher-pair joints, and other special constraints.

---

### Rotation Matrices About Principal Axes
- **Rotation about the x-axis by $\alpha$**  

    $$
    R_x(\alpha) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \cos \alpha & -\sin \alpha \\
        0 & \sin \alpha & \cos \alpha
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

- **Rotation about the y-axis by $\beta$**  

    $$
    R_y(\beta) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos \beta & 0 & \sin \beta \\
        0 & 1 & 0 \\
        -\sin \beta & 0 & \cos \beta
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

- **Rotation about the z-axis by $\gamma$**  

    $$
    R_z(\gamma) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos \gamma & -\sin \gamma & 0 \\
        \sin \gamma & \cos \gamma & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

Any 3D rotation can be expressed as a product of these fundamental rotations.


Quaternions provide a non-singular way to interpolate and compute 3D orientations, often used in control and simulation. -->

## Programming

Let's move on to maybe the most exciting part: applying the kinematics concepts you've learned in code and seeing your robot working right in front of you!

*(Please refer to the **Install Webots** section if you haven't installed it yet.)*


## **Exercise 1: Dobot Pick-and-Place (Forward Kinematics)** Level: **

### Step 1: Setup your environment

1. üìÅ [Download the `dobot` folder]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/downloads/kinematics/dobot_2025.zip)
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.
3. Launch Webots. From the top-left corner select **File ‚Üí Open World**.
4. Navigate to the extracted `dobot_2025/world` folder and select your `.wbt` file.


### Step 2: Let's start coding!

Once successfully opened, your robot and its environment should appear, as illustrated in the screenshot below:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ '/assets/images/kinematics/dobot.png' }}" width="500px" alt="Kinematics Image">


Now, follow the instructions provided on the right side panel within Webots, and complete the code to make your robot do the "**Pick and Place**".


> **üí° Helpful Suggestion:**  
> For detailed explanations of variables, robot schematics, and further clarifications that could greatly assist your understanding and coding, we strongly recommend reviewing the figures and content available on [this page from Robotics for Creative Practice](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/16-375/f2024/text/simulations/dobot.html).

> *If the Python file isn't open, select your robot in the scene tree (left panel), right-click and choose **Edit controller**, or load it manually via Webots' text editor (right panel) `dobot_2025/controllers/dobot` folder and select your `.py` .*

Once you've implemented all the "COMPLETE THIS LINE OF CODE" sections, click "Build" or "Save"(`CTRL+S`) to compile your project, and then start the simulation.

**Good luck and have fun!**

## **Exercise 2: IRB Robot Inverse Kinematics (Using IKPy)** Level: *

### Step 1: Coding 

1. üìÅ [Download the `irb` folder]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/downloads/kinematics/irb_2025.zip) (follow the same step as before).

üìÅ [Answers_irl]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/downloads/kinematics/inverse_kinematics.py)

</details>

### Step 2: Understanding the Process (Feedback)
As you've probably noticed by completing the coding exercise, manually programming inverse kinematics can become quite complex, especially for practical robotics applications. Usually, in real-world scenarios, specialized software or libraries are utilized to handle these calculations efficiently, rather than implementing all functions by hand. So you are very lucky for this chapter, you only need to understand how to use it !

In this example with your robot, a Python library called `ikpy` is used. This library provides convenient functions for computing inverse kinematics: you simply input the desired position (x, y, z), and the current joint positions, and `ikpy` performs all the necessary calculations.

If you're curious about how these calculations are done internally or if you'd like to learn more about this library, you can explore the official documentation [here](https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ikpy.html).

### Step 3: Observation 
You can also have some fun by clicking on the yellow-black sphere and translating or rotating it.
If your code is correct, the robot arm will continuously attempt to reach the sphere, as long as it remains within its workspace.
